Hello World

This is my Hello World project. So, hello to the world out there!

My name is Doug and I currently reside in Indiana, USA. I am a chemical engineer by degree but dabble in coding. I am working to take my skills to a new level by pursuing a Master of Data Science degree. Currently I am finishing bridge courses at Indiana University. I plan to start a formal program in the Fall of 2020.
